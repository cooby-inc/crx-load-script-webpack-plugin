# Chrome extension HMR example

- Run `npm run dev` and navigate to https://web.whatsapp.com.
- Modify the `app.js` to see the HMR.

Here is a simple demonstration of the Chrome extension manifest v3. While you may encounter some error or warning messages in the background script, they won't impact the HMR. If you'd like to avoid these warnings or explore a more advanced project configuration, check out the [crx-hmr-mv3-advance](../crx-hmr-mv3-advance).
